## [v0.10.3](https://github.com/kalvn/Shaarli-Material/releases/tag/v0.10.3) - 2019-03-29
Be careful, one important change comes with this release: the `build` folder is not anymore part of the code repository. So if you use to update the theme with `git pull`, you now need to do

```bash
$ git pull
$ npm install
$ gulp build
```

This will install build tools and process files. I'll now attach ready-to-use built theme to each release, similarly to what is done for Shaarli.

**Known issue:** the build process outputs scary errors due to new version of *uncss* not understanding properly some links containing RainTPL markup. This doesn't prevent it from working properly so you can ignore.

### Changed
- Processed JS and CSS files are not anymore in code repository.
- Reorganisation of directories in order to keep `/material` directory clean.
- Updated dependencies.
- Updated Gulp to v4.
- Refreshed linklist page design.

### Removed
- Bower. Front-end dependencies are now also retrieved with NPM.

- Error on permalink page due to inexistant variables with Shaarli v0.10.2.

### Removed
